    Regardless of what metric you go by, there is no more significant luxury watch brand on Earth than Rolex. From name recognition to reputation to actual sales numbers (Rolex accounts for nearly a third of today's Swiss luxury watch market share), The Crown always comes out on top. So for anyone seriously considering a luxury watch, be they a seasoned enthusiast or a curious novice, Rolex is definitely going to draw some consideration at some point in their search. And for many looking into buying a Rolex watch, the question may eventually come down to whether they should purchase a modern Rolex or a vintage one.
    </br>
    Modern Rolexes are undoubtedly impressive. Increasingly positioned as serious luxury items, much of the brand's current output is flashy and bordering on ostentatious. They're still excellent watches and as durable as ever, but one could argue that they lack the charm of Rolex's vintage pieces. Once upon a time, Rolex produced tool watches for the everyman. And while they were always positioned as a higher-end brand, they were still something most middle-class people could save up for fairly easily — something that can't really be said about Rolex today. So to celebrate Rolex's twentieth-century heyday, we've gone and compiled this guide to the ten best vintage Rolexes out there.

        <h2>Why Vintage Rolex?</h2>
        <small>A Simpler Time</small>

    Rolex has been around since 1908, and the brand has been resoundingly successful for most of its history. From its early beginnings as a British-founded upstart disrupter to its current standing as the Swiss luxury watch standard, Rolex has always left a big mark on the watch industry. But for our money, the period when Rolex shined brightest was from the 1950s to the 1980s. It was during this time that the brand was at its most imaginative and groundbreaking, as Rolex pioneered waterproof cases and pushed them to their limits, while also inventing useful everyday complications like the GMT.
    </br>
    This era also saw Rolex debut many of its best-known models, including the Submariner, Daytona, GMT-Master, and Explorer. All of these watches were purpose-built tools designed for divers, drivers, pilots, and adventurers, and their simple styling became associated with mid-century cool. It's this combination of romanticized use by men of action and timeless, rugged aesthetics that have led to the market for vintage Rolexes being arguably the hottest in the entire watch industry. And with that popularity comes high prices — very high, in some cases. All of the watches in this guide will set you back at least five figures, with some routinely commanding six- and even seven-figure sums. It's a bit ironic that Rolex's more utilitarian timepieces often cost a great deal more today than the brand's current ultra-luxury offerings, but prices are driven by the market and the market loves vintage Rolex.

        <h2>Buyer Beware</h2>
        <small>The Pitfalls Of Vintage Watch Buying</small>
    </div>
    <p>
    Before we get into our list of the best <a href="#">vintage</a> Rolex watches, it's important to offer up a bit of a warning about buying vintage watches. As we mentioned already, these watches are all very expensive, and before spending this kind of money on anything — especially a decades-old mechanical device — you need to do your due diligence to avoid being ripped off. There's a saying in the watch community that you “buy the seller” and not the watch, and it really rings true here. Make sure you look into who's selling the watch and only purchase from a trusted dealer. The vintage watch market is a minefield full of scams, fakes, and cobbled-together “Frankenwatches,” and if you're not careful you can easily lose thousands of dollars, so you should also heavily research the model you're after so you know what inconsistencies to look out for. Finally, if possible, it's also a good idea to consult experts on online forums and elsewhere to get a second opinion before making a purchase on any high-priced vintage watch.

    <h3>ROLEX COSMOGRAPH DAYTONA “PAUL NEWMAN”</h3>
    <p>
        Even if you're not familiar with vintage Rolexes, you've probably heard of the “Paul Newman” Daytona. An example of one of these watches, owned by the eponymous actor himself, once held the record for the most expensive watch ever sold at auction after a buyer paid for $17.8 million for it in 2017. The Daytona is Rolex's chronograph, and the only thing separating a “Newman” from a regular Daytona of the same vintage is the dial. “Newman” Daytonas have what Rolex used to refer to as “Exotic” dials. These dials, always in panda or reverse panda colorways, have a different font and slightly different markings compared to the standard Daytona dials, with their Art Deco numerals and square markings on the subdials being the most significant things to look out for.
